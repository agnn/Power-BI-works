# Power-BI-works

Working in Power BI is always fun and challenging, every time and everyday you learn new things. Its just not about creating visuals, it’s about transforming raw data into meaningful visuals to solve any business challenge.

This is my first time participating in any challenge. Working on this project was fun and it made me brush up my skills in and taught me so much.
It’s rightly said, the best way to learn is to work on a project.

First a brief about the problem statement which is of a supply chain business, they wants to understand and improve their process so they can retain customers and expand to more metro cities. 

You will find detail information below.

My approach to the problem was understanding in depth the problem statement and then understand the data provide.

Clean and build a model and create measures and visuals. 

The most important part is to visualize the requirements at first in your mind and draw the rough sketch of it.

I will summarize my learnings briefly, but the list is never exhaustive,

    	Use of bookmarks intensively to create interactive switch buttons and hidden filter box/ information pane.
    	Use of custom charts.
    	Use of group by DAX function to create derived tables.
    	Understanding of supply chain domain matrices and KPI parameters.
    	Converting business requirements into visuals in turn generating insights and recommendations to point out areas of improvements.
    
I have tried my best to optimize the report to make it as interactive and informative
